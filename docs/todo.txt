ISSUE:
  return next(err) does not cut off rest of promise chain as expected
SOLUTION:
  next adds middleware to the stack, it does not interrupt middleware
  return next(err) works when it is outside a promise chain as it is ending its current middleware function
  inside a promise chain though, it is only returning from a current promise and not the actual middleware
  therefore, need to throw an error that is then caught, where the proceeding return next(err) is included
